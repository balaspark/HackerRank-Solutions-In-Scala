The Challenges of HackerRank Solved in Scala

All the solutions provided here, are solely developed by me (Somdip Dey), and the challenges were pursued while learning Scala on the way.

The name of the solution is the name of the challenge itself.
For example, the solution with name "Arrays - DS.scala" is also of the same name, 'Arrays - DS', as the problem on HackerRank website.
